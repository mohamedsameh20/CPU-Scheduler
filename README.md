# CPU-Scheduler

This is a Python-based CPU scheduling simulator implemented with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The program allows you to simulate and visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, with live updates for waiting times (WT), turnaround times (TAT), and process bursts. It also features a Gantt chart for visualizing process execution.

## Features:

#### Add processes: 
Input burst time and arrival time for each process.


#### Round Robin Scheduler: 
Simulates Round Robin scheduling with a time quantum and updates the remaining burst time for each process.


#### Live Gantt Chart: 
Displays process execution over time with color-coded blocks for each process.


#### Process Table: 
Shows details for each process, including Process ID, arrival time, burst time, remaining time, and completion status.


#### Metrics: 
Displays average waiting time (WT) and average turnaround time (TAT) once the simulation is complete.


#### Static & Live Modes: 
You can choose between live simulation or a static run.

#### Reset Functionality: 
Resets the simulation to start over with new processes.
